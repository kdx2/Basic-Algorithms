## Linear search
It is a fundamental search algorithm in Computer Science with the following time complexities:

* Worst case: O(n)
* Average case: O(n)
* Best case: O(1)

## How the algorithm works
*Given a sorted array*:
1. Take the value you'll be looking for.
2. Start at one end of the array, walking towards the other
3. Check if the current element is the one we're looking for.
4. If so, return its index.
